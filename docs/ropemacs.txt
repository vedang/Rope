=========================
 ropemacs, rope in emacs
=========================

Using rope in emacs.  You should install `rope`_ library before using
ropemacs.

.. _`rope`: http://rope.sf.net/


New Features
============


Setting Up
==========

You can get Pymacs from http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pinard/pymacs/.
But version 0.22 does not work with Python 2.5 because of the lack of
file encoding declarations.  A simple patch is included:
``docs/pymacs_python25.patch``.

After installing pymacs, add these lines to your ``~/.emacs`` file::

  (load-library "pymacs")
  (pymacs-load "ropemacs" "rope-")
  (rope-init)
