the root folder of your project (this file is created the first time
you open a project).


Project Road Map
================

The main motive for starting this project was the lack of good
refactoring tools for Python programming language.  Refactoring
programs like "bicycle repair man" aren't reliable due to type
inference problems and they support a limited number of refactorings.
*Rope* tries to improve these limitations.

The main goal of *rope* is to concentrate on the type inference and
refactoring of python programs and not a state of art IDE (at least
not in the first phase).  The type inference and refactoring parts
will not be dependent on *rope* IDE and if successful, will be
released as standalone programs and libraries so that other projects
may use them.
